# Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found.
# If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
# NOTE: You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
# Output: 2

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
# Output: 1

# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
# Output: 4
